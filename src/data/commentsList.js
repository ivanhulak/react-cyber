      comment: 'I was a bit nervous to be buying a secondhand phone from Amazon, but I couldnâ€™t be happier with my purchase!! I have a pre-paid data plan so I was worried that this phone wouldnâ€™t connect with my data plan, since the new phones donâ€™t have the physical Sim tray anymore, but couldnâ€™t have been easier! I bought an Unlocked black iPhone 14 Pro Max in excellent condition and everything is PERFECT. It was super easy to set up and the phone works and looks great. It truly was in excellent condition. Highly recommend!!!ðŸ–¤',

      comment: 'This phone has 1T storage and is durable. Plus all the new iPhones have a C port! Apple is phasing out the current ones! (All about the Benjaminâ€™s) So if you want a phone thatâ€™s going to last grab an iPhone 14 pro max and get several cords and plugs.',
